# How to install the virtual environment

- Open a console prompt in the framework's root folder.
- Create a new virtual environment using `virtualenv env` (`env` is a name that is commonly given to Python virtual environments).
  - If you have different versions of Python in your system, especially if Python 2 and 3 are installed alongside each other, it is recommended to specify the Python version using `virtualenv -p python3 env`.
- Activate the virtual environment using `env\Scripts\activate` (Windows) or `source env/bin/activate` (Linux & Mac).
- Install Silence's requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
